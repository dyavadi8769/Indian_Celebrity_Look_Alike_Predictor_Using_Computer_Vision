# Indian-Celebrity-Look-Alike-Predictor

A Deep learning based streamlit web app which can tell with which Indian bollywood celebrity your face resembles.

Face recognition is the problem of identifying and verifying people in a photograph by their face.
It is a task that is trivially performed by humans, even under varying light and when faces are changed by age or obstructed with accessories and facial hair. Nevertheless, it is remained a challenging computer vision problem for decades until recently.

Deep learning methods are able to leverage very large datasets of faces and learn rich and compact representations of faces, allowing modern models to first perform as-well and later to outperform the face recognition capabilities of humans.

In this project, you will discover the problem of face recognition and how deep learning methods can achieve superhuman performance to identify similar faces.

This is a methods of identifying similar faces check various aspects on pictures, including: face shape, nose, eyes and mouth; face position in the picture; skin color (including the lighting of the photo); color and hair and cosine_similarity.


# Steps Involved in the Project:

This repository hosts the Indian Celebrity Look-Alike Predictor project, which utilizes VGGFace for high-accuracy face recognition. The project features a modular pipeline encompassing:

1. **Data Ingestion:** Managed and processed over 5,000 images.
2. **Face Detection:** Used MTCNN for precise face detection and storing coordinates.
3. **Image Preprocessing:** Employed TensorFlow and Keras for robust preprocessing.
4. **Feature Extraction:** Leveraged VGGFace for extracting detailed facial features.
5. **Similarity Measurement:** Implemented cosine similarity to compare feature vectors, achieving 96% matching accuracy.
6. **Performance Optimization:** Reduced preprocessing time by 50%, ensuring scalable handling of large datasets.
7. **Deployment:** Designed an interactive web application with Streamlit, enabling real-time celebrity look-alike predictions with an average response time of under 2 seconds.

This project demonstrates efficient handling of large-scale image data and real-time prediction capabilities.
